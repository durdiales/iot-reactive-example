# iot-reactive-example

## Motivation

This repository contains some code examples focused on developing some IoT (Internet of Things) reactive platform using modern web technologies, which may be used as a short introduction guide to the SMACK stack (Spark Mesos Akka Cassandra Kafka).

In order to get a deeper knowledge about how functional programming may help to develop modern reactive platforms, focus will be on how to develop some multi-tier system, that will include some of the most required features in modern systems, among others: based on microservices, using some NoSQL persistent storage, and processing input data for near-real-time analytics.
